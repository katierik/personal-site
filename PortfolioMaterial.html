                    <h2> Experiment with material design</h2> 
                     <p>Material design has been a huge step forward in mobile computing. The metaphors and styles are great on simple mobile applications, but I was interested if any of the principles and lessons from material design could be applied to the very complex, very information dense, enterprise applications that I work with on a daily basis. </p>
                     <p>The design below is based on a multi-national insurance underwriting portal. The user, an insurance underwriter, is examining large amounts of data that is submitted by a customer seeking insurance coverage. Coverage spans many countries, and many locations within each country. </p>
                     <p>This mock-up shows how to drill into a particular country (click on Canada’s row) and see information about the specific locations within a country. It also shows a way of displaying meta data about the current item the underwriter is working on (expand the bottom footer). Tabs of more information is shown across the top (Program Structure, Exposure, Location, Facultative Reinsurance) in which the underwriter can see other data about this underwriting challenge. Navigation is primarily collapsed into Google’s hamburger menu, except for “Next” and “Back”, which are in the upper right-hand corner. </p>
