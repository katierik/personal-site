                    <h2> Mobile Insurance Application</h2> 
                     <p>This was a fun little project. Not a huge part of my job is designing for consumer applications, as most of my work is focused on enterprise apps. When I had the opportunity to put together something for a demo, I jumped at the opportunity. </p>
                     <p>This design is fairly simple as development was working in a very tight time frame, however it was important for the app to have an element of fun. This design uses OCR scanning and database lookups to reduce the amount of data the user needs to manually enter and is very quick to fill in.</p>
                     <p>A couple screenshots are below, or you can click through the prototype yourself.</p>
                     <p>(Created with Illustrator and Marvel)</p>
